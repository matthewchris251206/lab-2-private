### Question 4

When writing a function in pure assembly code, it is important to distinguish between *caller* and *callee*, because they have different responsibilities. (e.g., caller-saved/callee-saved registers)
In the case of **recursive function**, however, it is hard to distinguish between caller and callee. How do you solve the problem? Please explain it briefly.
